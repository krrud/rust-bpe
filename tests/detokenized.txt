lincoln's gettysburg address, given november 19, 1863
on the battlefield near gettysburg, pennsylvania, usa


four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth
upon this continent a new nation:  conceived in liberty, and
dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

now we are engaged in a great civil war. . .testing whether
that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated. . .
can long endure.  we are met on a great battlefield of that war.

we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place
for those who here gave their lives that this nation might live.
it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

but, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate. . .we cannot consecrate. . .
we cannot hallow this ground.  the brave men, living and dead,
who struggled here have consecrated it, far above our poor power
to add or detract.  the world will little note, nor long remember,
what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.

it is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished
work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining
before us. . .that from these honored dead we take increased devotion
to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion. . .
that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain. . .
that this nation, under god, shall have a new birth of freedom. . .
and that government of the people. . .by the people. . .for the people. . .
shall not perish from this earth.
